# welcome:

Hi, my name is Galileu Kim and I am a reseracher at the [Development Impact Evaluation](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime) at the World Bank. My research focuses on the political economy of bureaucracy and public services, with a focus on municipalities in Brazil. You can find some of my research and codes [here](https://github.com/galileukim).

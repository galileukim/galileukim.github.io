Hi, my name is Galileu Kim and I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Princeton University. My research focuses on the political economy of bureaucracy and public services, with a focus on municipalities in Brazil. 

You can find some of my research and codes [here](https://github.com/galileukim).

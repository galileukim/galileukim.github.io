Hello, my name is Galileu Kim and I am a Public Sector Specialist at the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home). I am a member of the [Bureaucracy Lab](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime/brief/Bureaucracy-Lab) team at the [Development Impact Evaluation (DIME)](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime), where I partner with government counterparts to strengthen public administration. I am a research fellow in Brazil's [National School of Administration (ENAP)](https://www.enap.gov.br/).

My research focuses on the political economy of bureaucracy, with a substantive focus on personnel management, corruption and public service delivery. Methodologically, I combine techniques from data science, causal inference, on-the-ground fieldwork and formal theory to analyze how municipal governments can better serve their citizens.

I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science from Princeton University, and a B.A. in Political Science and Economics from the University of Pennsylvania.

You can find my research projects and replication files [here](https://github.com/galileukim).

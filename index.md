Hello, my name is Galileu Kim and I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Princeton University. My research focuses on the political economy of bureaucracy and public service delivery, with a substantive focus on municipal governments in Brazil. Methodologically, I combine techniques from data science, causal inference, on-the-ground fieldwork and formal theory to analyze how municipal governments can better serve their citizens.

At Princeton, I am a member of the Research Program on Political Economy, Brazil Lab and a Lassen Fellow for the Program in Latin American Studies. I have received generous funding from the Mamdouha S. Bobst Center for Peace and Justice, Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies and the Program in Latin American Studies. 

I am currently a data scientist for EloGroup, where I have partnered with Brazil's federal government to detect frauds in the federal bureaucracy payroll and improve the Brazilian national employment system (SINE). As a research affiliate at the *Instituto del Per√∫*, I authored a paper on technological diffusion in Peru and collaborated on a comparative study on the political and economic development in the Andes.

I hold a B.A. *summa cum laude* in political science and economics from the University of Pennsylvania.

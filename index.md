## welcome

Hello, my name is Galileu Kim and I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Princeton University. My research focuses on the political economy of bureaucracy and public service delivery, with a substantive focus on municipal governments in Brazil. Methodologically, I combine techniques from data science, causal inference, on-the-ground fieldwork and formal theory to analyze how municipal governments can better serve their citizens.

At Princeton, I am a member of the Research Program on Political Economy, Brazil Lab and a Lassen Fellow for the Program in Latin American Studies. I have received generous research funding from the Mamdouha S. Bobst Center for Peace and Justice, Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies and the Program in Latin American studies. 

I am a data science consultant for EloGroup, where I work on projects to detect frauds in the Brazilian federal bureaucracy and improve the Brazilian national employment system (SINE). I am a research affiliate at the *Instituto del Per√∫* in Lima, where I authored a paper on technological diffusion in Peru and collaborated in a comparative study on political and economic development in the Andean region.

I hold a B.A. in political science and economics from University of Pennsylvania.

## welcome

hello, my name is Galileu Kim and I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Princeton University. my research focuses on the political economy of bureaucracy and public service delivery, with a substantive focus on municipal governments in Brazil. methodologically, I combine techniques from data science, causal inference, on-the-ground fieldwork and formal theory to analyze how municipal governments can better serve their citizens.

at Princeton, I am a member of the Research Program on Political Economy, Brazil Lab and a Lassen Fellow for the Program in Latin American Studies. Funding for research was generously provided by the Mamdouha S. Bobst Center for Peace and Justice, Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies and the Program in Latin American Studies. 

I am currently a data science consultant for EloGroup, where I have partnered with the Brazilian federal government to detect frauds in the federal bureaucracy payroll and improve the Brazilian national employment system (SINE). As a research affiliate at the *Instituto del Per√∫*, I have authored a paper on technological diffusion in Peru and worked on a comparative study on the political and economic development in the Andean region with Richard C. Webb and Giovanni Bonfiglio.

I hold a B.A. *summa cum laude* in political science and economics from University of Pennsylvania.

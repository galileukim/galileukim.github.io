Hello, my name is Galileu Kim and I am a data science consultant at the World Bank. I am a member of the [Bureaucracy Lab](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime/brief/Bureaucracy-Lab) and [DE JURE](https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/923891592406548876-0050022020/original/DEJUREBrief.pdf) teams at the Department of Impact Evaluation (DIME), where I partner with government counterparts to leverage data science for strengthening evidence-based policy-making.

My research focuses on the political economy of bureaucracy and public service delivery, with a substantive focus on municipal governments in Brazil. Methodologically, I combine techniques from data science, causal inference, on-the-ground fieldwork and formal theory to analyze how municipal governments can better serve their citizens.

At Princeton, I was a member of the Research Program on Political Economy, Brazil Lab and a Lassen Fellow for the Program in Latin American Studies. I have received generous funding from the Mamdouha S. Bobst Center for Peace and Justice, Princeton Institute for International and Regional Studies and the Program in Latin American Studies.

I hold a Ph.D. in Political Science from Princeton University, and a B.A. in Political Science and Economics from the University of Pennsylvania.

# welcome:

Hello, my name is Galileu Kim and I am a Ph.D. candidate in political science at Princeton University. My research focuses on the political economy of bureaucracy and public service delivery, with a substantive focus on municipal governments in Brazil. Methodologically, I combine techniques from data science, causal inference, on-the-ground fieldwork and formal theory to analyze how municipal governments can better serve their citizens.

At Princeton, I am a member of the Research Program on Political Economy and a Lassen Fellow for the Program in Latin American Studies. Additionally, I am an external data scientist for EloGroup, where I worked on two separate projects to improve the Brazilian government. One was to determine the incidence of fraudulent invoices in the federal bureaucracy. Another on a project to improve matching algorithms in the Brazilian national employment system (SINE) to better serve citizens. I am a research affiliate at the *Instituto del Per√∫* in Lima, where I authored a paper on technological diffusion in Peru and a comparative study on political and economic development in the Andean region.

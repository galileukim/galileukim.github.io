I have been fortunate to collaborate with scholars and practitioners on the field to produce policy oriented research. You will find below a list of these joint endeavors.

### working papers:

- "Government through patronage: the bargain for education in decentralized Brazil".

- "Representation failure", with Matias Iaryczower and Sergio Montero.
- "Corporate Interests and Campaign Donations in Brazilian Municipalities", with James Mao.

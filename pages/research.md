## research

My research agenda focuses on the political economy of bureaucracies in developing countries, building on my substantive knowledge of municipal governments in Brazil. I have been fortunate to collaborate with scholars and practitioners on the field to produce public-policy oriented research.

- ["Government through patronage: bargaining for education in decentralized Brazil"](/files/papers/patronage_education.pdf).
- ["Are anti-corruption audits effective? Evidence from Brazil"](/files/papers/corrupt_audit.pdf), with Romain Ferrali.

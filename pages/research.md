I have been fortunate to collaborate with scholars and practitioners on the field to produce policy oriented research. You will find below a list of these joint endeavors.

### working papers:

- ["Government through patronage: the bargain for education in decentralized Brazil"](/files/papers/patronage_education.pdf).
- ["Are anti-corruption audits effective? Evidence from Brazil"](/files/papers/corrupt_audit.pdf), with Romain Ferrali.
- ["Representation failure"](/files/papers/representation_failure.pdf), with Matias Iaryczower and Sergio Montero.
- ["Corporate Interests and Campaign Donations in Brazilian Municipalities"](/files/papers/campaign_portfolio.pdf), with James Mao.

## data

Access to public data is indispensable for scientific research. However, this same data is often times in foreign languages, stranger formats and even more obscure encoding. In my personal research, have worked extensively cleaning Brazilian administrative data more accessible for myself and fellow researchers.

Fortunately, I am not alone: wonderful projects are expanding at [brazil.io](https://brasil.io/home/), [electionsBR](http://electionsbr.com/), and the government official [dadosbr](https://github.com/dadosgovbr).

Below you will find some of the data I have collected and cleaned throughout my research. If you have any requests for additional data please do not hesitate to contact me!

- Conversion table for IBGE-TSE municipal identifiers ([here](/data/cod_ibge_tse.csv)).
- Campaign donations to politicians ([here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10VGLknUIpxcBXIJ8P2XkVyScZrUgm_w0/view?usp=sharing))
